# Publishing Single Assets and Widgets

With Liferay DXP, you can publish single assets and widgets when needed, without going through the entire publication process. This strategy allows you to fine-tune your publications more specifically than publishing all content at once.

## Publishing Single Assets

To publish assets in this way, Users must have the following permissions: *Export/Import Application Info* and *Publish Staging*. See [Managing Staging Permissions](./managing-staging-permissions.md) for more information.

Follow these steps to publish a single asset:

1. Go to *Content & Data* in the *Product* menu, and select the content or data type you would like to publish.

1. Click on the *Actions* button ( ![Actions button](./../../images/icon-actions.png) ) for the asset you want to publish, and select *Publish to Live*.

   ![Click on the Actions button for the asset you want to publish, and select Publish to Live.](./publishing-single-assets-and-widgets/images/01.png)

Once you confirm your publication, you'll be directed to a process page where you can see the status of your publication.

Similar to the standard publication process, single asset publications include associated dependencies, whether images, custom templates, or folders.

```note::
   Single asset publication is not supported for page-scoped content.
```

## Publishing Single Widgets

Although Staging is typically used to publish content, you can also publish widgets. For example, you can modify a widget's title and publish the change to live. This is possible because widget configurations are always staged. To publish a widget that is on a Page, you must publish the Page first.

After changing a widget, you can publish the widget by clicking on the *Actions* button ( ![Actions button](./../../images/icon-actions.png) ) for the widget and selecting *Staging*.
